# Waver---Sound

This project consist on being a sound analyzer, aka Spectrum Viwer. It was made with Unity Engine, using C#.

The plane mesh (generated in run time) gets defformed depending on the sound spectrum. That is done by changing some vertices position depending on the value returned by spectrum.

More information can be find inside the scripts :)
